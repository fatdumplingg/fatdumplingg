#### 🌻 About Me 🪴
I am currently a 2nd-year undergraduate student working as the department's Computing Laboratory Assistant. I'm deeply intrigued in the fast-paced developments of IT, particularly anything related to Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition, or Cryptography.
Here are some technologies I am comfortable working with :
- Java
- C++
- Python
- Tensorflow, Pandas, Seaborn, and other libraries
  
To keep my right-brain in high performance, I periodically take *Game Designer* and *UI Artist* roles too, making playable game apps for competitions. 
Some are listed in 🎮 [my itch.io page](https://littleshumai.itch.io/)! 
Outside of those, I am interested in developments of science, such as in the medical industry.

I can be easily contacted through [email](sashannbl@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/sashannbl) 🖤 Let's talk on projects we can work on together!
