## Hi, Sasha here ðŸ‘‹  Thanks for stopping by!

#### ðŸŒ» About Me ðŸª´
I'm an undergraduate working part-time as the department's Computing Laboratory Teaching Assistant. I am deeply intrigued in the fast-paced developments of IT, particularly anything related to Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition, or Cryptography.
Some technologies I have comfortably worked with are :
- Java
- C++
- Python
- Pandas, Seaborn, CV2, MatplotLib, Tensorflow, and other libraries
  
To keep my right-brain in high performance, I periodically take *Game Designer* and *UI Artist* roles too, making playable game apps for competitions. 
Some are listed in ðŸŽ® [my itch.io page!](https://littleshumai.itch.io/)
Outside of those, I am interested in any social developments and daily news.

I can be easily contacted through [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/sashannbl) ðŸ–¤ Let's talk on projects we can work on together!
