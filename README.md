## Hi, Sasha here ðŸ‘‹  Thanks for stopping by!

#### ðŸŒ» About Me ðŸª´
I'm an undergraduate working part-time as the department's Computing Laboratory Teaching Assistant. I am deeply intrigued in the fast-paced developments of IT, particularly anything related to Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition, or Cryptology. Some technologies I have comfortably worked with are :
- Java
- C++
- Python
- Pandas, Seaborn, CV2, MatplotLib, Tensorflow, and other libraries
  
To keep my right-brain in its toes, I periodically take *Game Designer* and *UI Artist* roles, making playable game apps for competitions with my dev team like the ones listed in ðŸŽ® [my itch.io page.](https://oceanparty.itch.io/) ðŸŽ²
Outside of those, I am interested in any social developments and daily news.
