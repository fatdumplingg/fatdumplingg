- 🏫 I am a second-year university student who is deeply intrigued with high impact applications, especially those Machine Learning or Pattern Algorithm related. 
- 🖥️ I've been teaching Java & C++ as the school's department laboratory assistant for the past year too, covering 4 classes and 3 different professors in total.
- ⚡ As used in most of my academic projects, I am comfortable working using Java, C++, Python, Tensorflow, Pandas, Seaborn, ScikitLearn, and many more. 
- 🎮 To test my creativity, I make game applications as a *Game Designer* periodically, so do head to [My Itch.io Page](https://littleshumai.itch.io/) if games are your thing! 
- ✍️ I can be easily contacted through [email](sashannbl@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/sashannbl). Feel free to reach out for any projects we can work on together!

- P.S. Yes, as you see from my username, dumplings are an absolute, dear favorite food!
